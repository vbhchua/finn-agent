# finn — Field Notes

Hard-won learnings from building **finn** on **NVIDIA NemoClaw / OpenShell** — a sandboxed,
deny-by-default agent runtime. Each entry is *symptom → root cause → fix*, distilled from the
build log ([PROGRESS.md](../PROGRESS.md)); the security model and trust boundaries live in
[`architecture/`](../architecture/_index.md).

The theme across all of them: **in a sandboxed agent runtime, the failure you see is rarely the
layer that's broken.** Network namespaces make healthy services look dead, env scrubbing makes
working credentials vanish, and cached runtimes make registered tools invisible — so the
debugging discipline is to find the *authoritative* signal (usually a log, never a probe) before
touching anything.

---

## 1. The egress trap: an MCP child does not inherit the gateway's network

**Symptom.** A custom MCP server (calendar, Notion) works perfectly when tested by hand, but the
agent insists it has *"no access — blocked by the network policy."*

**Root cause — three stacked facts, each individually verified:**

1. The OpenClaw gateway runs in its **own network namespace** where direct egress is blocked;
   everything must go through the egress proxy (which also does **TLS interception** with its
   own CA).
2. When the gateway spawns an MCP server subprocess, it **scrubs the environment** — the child
   gets none of `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` / `NODE_OPTIONS`. The `env` block in the
   `mcp.servers` config **does not reach the child** either.
3. A hand test via `docker exec` runs in the **main** netns, where direct egress is open — so
   every out-of-band probe (`diagnostics`, `mcp probe`) succeeds and **actively misleads you**.

So the gateway-spawned child sits in a proxy-only netns with a bare env, tries a direct
`fetch()`, and is blocked — while every test you run says it's fine.

**Fix: the server self-bootstraps by re-exec.** On startup, if it has no `HTTPS_PROXY`, it walks
its process ancestry (`/proc/<ppid>/environ` — the gateway parent *has* the proxy env) and
re-execs itself with `HTTPS_PROXY` + `NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1` +
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=<the proxy's MITM CA>`. Run out-of-band (no proxied ancestor), it skips the
re-exec and fetches directly — auto-adapting to both contexts. See `mcp/ms-calendar-mcp.mjs`.

**Corollary:** an out-of-process MCP server is *not* automatically simpler than an in-process
plugin — a plugin shares the gateway's proxy dispatcher and CA for free; an MCP child must
bootstrap its own egress.

## 2. MCP registration and the cached runtime

- **The on-disk config key is `mcp.servers`, not `mcpServers`.** The bundled code references
  `mcpServers` 171× (it's the *import/discovery* name), but a hand-patch of a top-level
  `mcpServers` key is silently ignored. Register via the CLI (`openclaw mcp set <name> '{…}'`),
  which writes the right key.
- **Registering a server hot-reloads the config but does NOT rebuild the cached MCP runtime** —
  the agent keeps materializing tools from the *old* catalog, so it truthfully reports "no such
  tool" while `mcp list` shows the server. The fix on this build is a **full gateway restart**
  (there is no `mcp reload` subcommand on OpenClaw 2026.5.27).
- **Restart the gateway by name + parent, not by argv pattern.** `pkill -f "gateway run"`
  silently fails on onboards where the worker's argv is rewritten to just `openclaw`. Match the
  `openclaw` process whose **parent is `nemoclaw-start`** and `kill -TERM` it — the supervisor
  relaunches a fresh gateway (which rebuilds the MCP runtime from scratch).

## 3. Observability: the log is authoritative — sockets lie

The gateway's own netns makes every socket-level health check false-negative from a
`docker exec` (default netns): `ss -ltn`, `netstat`, even `/proc/net/tcp` all show the gateway
port unbound while it is perfectly healthy.

- The only reliable "gateway up" signal is the **gateway log**: a fresh
  `[gateway] http server listening` + `ready`. A log that simply *stops* is usually idle, not
  hung (slow model calls can take 2+ minutes).
- **Never auto-kill the gateway on a socket check** — you'd kill a healthy gateway in a loop.
- The Docker healthcheck curls the health endpoint from the main netns → always fails → falls
  back to a pid file. After an out-of-band relaunch that file holds a **dead pid**, so the
  container reports `unhealthy` while Telegram and inference work fine. Refresh the pid file or
  do a clean `rebuild`.
- `openclaw config get` **redacts secrets** (`__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__`) — to verify a key actually
  landed, read the raw `openclaw.json` or make a live call.

## 4. Deny-by-default egress in practice

- **`NET:OPEN DENIED <site>` during research is expected, not a failure.** The agent's direct
  fetch to an arbitrary site is blocked by design, then the fetch provider (Firecrawl) scrapes
  it **server-side** through its single allow-listed endpoint. Ignore the auto-drafted
  per-site policy proposals — allowlisting individual sites would defeat the single-endpoint
  design.
- **The Firecrawl plugin's SSRF precheck needs `/etc/hosts` help.** Before each call it does a
  `dns.lookup` of its own endpoint to prove it isn't private — but the sandbox's local resolver
  can't resolve *any* external host (all real egress resolves via the proxy). Pin the endpoint
  in `/etc/hosts` with **any public IP**: the precheck passes, and the actual request still goes
  through the proxy, so the pinned IP never needs to be current.
- **`proxy.loopbackMode=gateway-only` is load-bearing, not a tweak.** With the stock `proxy`
  mode on this topology, the embedded agent's own loopback RPC to the gateway
  (127.0.0.1:18789) is routed into the OPA egress layer, which blocks
  loopback/link-local **unconditionally** — you cannot allowlist around SSRF hardening — and
  produces a ~1/sec denial flood. `gateway-only` takes the loopback RPC off the intercepted
  path; external egress is policed identically either way.

## 5. Sandbox lifecycle: what survives what

**The mental model that explains every trap here:** the sandbox data dir (`/sandbox/.openclaw`)
is **ephemeral — there is no bind-mount.** Everything added at runtime (channels, MCP servers,
cron jobs, API keys) lives only in the container's writable layer. A rebuild or re-onboard wipes
all of it; only host-side **egress policies** survive (they live in the NemoClaw blueprint, not
the image). Anything baked into the image (e.g. the Telegram token via `channels add`) survives
a rebuild.

- ⛔ **Never `docker restart` an OpenShell sandbox.** The entrypoint is the *supervisor*, driven
  by host orchestration — restarted raw, it just runs `sleep infinity`: the gateway never
  launches, and nothing will ever respawn it. Check for the supervisor loop with
  `ps -eo args | grep -c "[n]emoclaw-start"` (≥1 = alive).
- **The restart ladder:** (1) config change → `kill -TERM` the gateway worker (see §2), the
  supervisor respawns it; (2) wedged state → `nemoclaw <name> rebuild` for a clean
  supervisor-managed boot; (3) `recover` is a last resort — it relaunches out-of-band, leaves a
  stale pid marker (§3), and does not restore the supervisor loop.
- **Recovery after a wipe is a runbook, not archaeology:** secrets live in a gitignored `.env`,
  and every setup script is idempotent — re-run `channels add` → the runmods → the setup script,
  then verify (MCP list, cron list, one live search). Design for the wipe on day one.

## 6. Re-onboard traps

- **"Auto-injected" credentials are only injected on a *fresh* onboard.** A bare re-onboard
  leaves the search provider with a placeholder key and its egress preset inactive →
  `web_search` fails with a generic *"fetch failed"*. The setup script now re-applies key +
  egress idempotently — a bare re-onboard is not a no-op.
- **Provider-profile import has no `--force`.** A re-run fails with *"custom provider profile
  'brave' already exists."* It's non-fatal (the profile is a template; the provider *instance*
  holding the key is a separate object and keeps working) — delete the stale template first.
- **A policy preset copied into the blueprint *registers* it** — after that,
  `policy-add --from-file` collides with the name. Pick one flow: register + activate by name,
  or keep the file self-contained under a unique name.
- **Credentials are snapshotted at submit/onboard time** — fix creds *before* the operation
  that consumes them, not after.

## 7. Scheduling agent work on a pinned platform

Getting three cron loops (daily radar, weekly trends, weekly digest) to run required three
non-obvious mechanics:

1. **`openclaw cron` is a live WS client to the gateway — which is unreachable from the main
   netns.** Registration must run *inside the gateway netns*: find the gateway pid, read its
   auth token, and `nsenter -t <pid> -n` (see `radar/gw-cron.sh`).
2. **`cron add` needs `operator.admin`, but a headless onboard has no admin device to approve
   the upgrade** — the request pends forever. Grant the scope directly in the on-disk device
   table and restart the gateway (`radar/grant-cron-admin.py`, idempotent). This widens no
   egress — it only lets the local operator schedule what the in-process agent could already do.
3. **Scheduled cron turns run context-stripped on this OpenClaw version — the model never calls
   tools**, it just echoes the prompt template, while reporting `delivered:true`. Verify
   scheduled runs by their *effects* (real Notion writes), never by the delivery flag. The only
   path that reliably drives tools is a full agent invocation (`openclaw agent --agent main`).

**The design lesson: strong model authors, weak model executes.** A frontier model wrote the
execution prompts *for* the weaker scheduled executor — literal cadence tables, exact property
names, the query JSON spelled out, few-shot output formats, "if unsure → skip" fallbacks — and
the loop was decomposed to one item per run. Whether that scaffolding is still needed after a
model upgrade is a **cost-per-completed-task** question, not an architecture question.

## 8. Upgrading a version-pinned fork safely

NemoClaw pins OpenClaw and applies string-match source patches that **fail closed** — the right
posture for a security-sensitive base, and it changes how you upgrade:

- The upgrade path is **bump the pinning layer, never the pinned dependency in place**.
- When upstream patch support stops (here: a one-field minified-source delta at OpenClaw
  2026.6.9), write the **minimal tolerance** in the same style as the original patch, keep it
  fail-closed and self-verifying, and **vendor it in the repo**
  (`patches/nemoclaw-2026.6.x-chat-send-runid.patch`) so the base stays reproducible.
- **Prove the full image builds with all patches applied before touching the live agent** — a
  non-destructive build is cheap; a broken live sandbox is not (§5).

## 9. Topology quirks (macOS host-process install)

On this install the OpenShell gateway is a **host process**, not a container — and several
diagnostics assume the Linux container layout:

- `doctor` reports a missing cluster container that never exists here — a false negative; don't
  "fix" it by renaming the sandbox container (its name encodes the UUID every command uses).
- The in-sandbox `inference.local` DNS entry is lost on some restarts, and the auto-repair path
  hunts for that same non-existent container. A clean rebuild re-establishes it.
- Shared-endpoint inference flakiness (`LLM idle timeout`, worker limits) surfaces as *"agent
  run failed before producing a reply"* — **isolate with a no-tool prompt before chasing a
  config bug.** Wiring bugs are deterministic; capacity bugs are not.

## 10. Writing a zero-dep MCP server (craft notes)

- **stdout is the protocol.** All logging goes to stderr, or you corrupt the JSON-RPC stream.
- **Drain before exit.** A piped client half-closes stdin the instant it finishes writing —
  exit on `end` with a call in flight and the last response is dropped. Track pending calls.
- **Secrets in a `0600` file owned by the sandbox user**, read by the server — never in the
  agent config (which would sync/rebuild them around) and never baked into image layers.
- **Read-only by default; write is an explicit opt-in** (`*_WRITE=1` + a write-scoped token).
  The real guard is the **OAuth scope**, not the egress method list — a read-scoped token gets
  403 on writes even where policy allows the verb. Defense in depth, scope first: irreversible
  tools are reachable by prompt-injected web content, so they don't exist unless opted in.
- Zero dependencies (raw stdio JSON-RPC + `fetch`) means no install step through the proxy, no
  SDK version coupling, and a server small enough to audit line-by-line.
